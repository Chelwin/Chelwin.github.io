# Welcome to Chelwin's virtual space
Hi! I'm glad you stopped by. You can check out my blogposts, some of which are my ramblings on varied topics while most others are just a collection of points I'm trying to memorize while taking up a new skill. You might also want to take a look at my projects. While most of them are in the area of  HPC or Parallel programming, you are sure to find some of the more quirky ones like the <i>'spring-tease' </i> repo. Oh, and you're welcome to contribute on my public projects!
