## Anchor tag; href, and target attributes
- Use the `id` of the element you are referencing to in the place of the link
ex.  `<a href= "#footer"> Designed By Sierra Oscar-Romeo </a>`
redirects to the footer of the page with the id `#footer`.

- Use the attribute `target = "_blank"` with anchor tag to force opening of the link referenced in the href attribute in a new window-tab

- Create a deaed link by setting the href attribute to `"#"`
