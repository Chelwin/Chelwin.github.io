    Welcome to Sanchi's virtual space
    <p>
    Hi! I'm glad you stopped by. You can check out my blogposts, some of which are my ramblings on varied topics while most
    others are just a collection of points I'm trying to memorize while taking up a new skill. You might also want to take a
    look at my projects. While most of them are in the area of  HPC or Parallel programming, you are sure to find some of the
    more quirky ones like the <i>'spring-tease' </i> repo. Oh, and you're welcome to contribute on my public projects! 
    </p>
